# ToDoApp

- A simple to do application built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- A text input is placed near the top next to a submit button(the "+" sign).

- The text is added to list below.

- Each to do item contains a completed button and a delete button.

- The completed button (check box), will cross out and fade the text to show that the task is done.

- The delete button (trashcan box), will completely remove the task from the list and move other accordingly and keep the list clean.
